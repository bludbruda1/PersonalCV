      <p>
        During my time as a Product Owner at BNZ, I developed and implemented transparent and practical roadmaps for our
        stakeholders. I also managed to shorten the time for delivering new components to consuming teams from half a
        year or a year to a couple of months. Additionally, I presented our quarterly plans to our stakeholders,
        highlighting the benefits of the work we planned to do. My focus on engaging customers helped me to gather
        valuable feedback and identify areas for improvement. I also created sprint goals, including stories, tasks, and
        bug fixes, for our team to complete and review our progress as a team each sprint.

        I was responsible for delivering a test strategy plan to my team. This included creating a plan, presenting it,
        and incorporating feedback from the team. As a T-shaped team member, I fulfilled various roles such as Product
        Owner, Business Analyst, and even assisted with development tasks where required. I also took on the role of
        team facilitator during quarterly planning. This involved communicating with other teams to understand their
        requirements and how we could incorporate their work into our quarter plans. I was responsible for presenting at
        monthly Guild, Engineering All-Hands, and Testing Guild meetings as well. In addition, I created a set of
        Cypress automation tests that regressed our Design System site.

        During the Covid-19 outbreak, I successfully led our team through urgent and time-sensitive work. I went beyond
        my role and stepped up as a team leader, which showcased my ability to step up in high-pressure circumstances.
        As a T-shaped team member, I was versatile and contributed to various tasks ranging from Product Owner work to
        Development on the apps. I made a conscious effort to position myself to best support the team in any way
        possible. I took on the responsibility of facilitating team ceremonies. This included retrospectives, planning,
